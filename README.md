## Issues And Bugs
 The developer came across multiple bugs when implementing some features on the website, the ones that was more noticeable, along with the solutions are listed below:

 * Envelope Icon
 
 When trying to change the icons for Maya's social the enevlope icon would take its own properties and react differently to the other two icons. To get around this issue I had to create its own custom class that I would call from the css file in order to get all icons across the webpage to all act in unison.

## Deployment

* Deploying on GitHub Pages

In order for this page to be deployed to GitHub Pages from its Github Repository, the following steps was taken:

1. Log into GitHub or create an acount.
2. Locate the GitHub Repository.
3. On the top menu of the repository select the settings tab.
4. Scroll down until you see the 'GitHub pages' section.
5. Under the 'Source' section of 'GitHub Pages' click the box labbeled 'None' and then select 'Master Branch'.
6. Upon clicking save the page will refresh meaning the website is now deployed.
7. Scroll back down to the 'GitHub Pages' section and you will now see the live link directing you to the website.
